# Monsters Rolodex

This project is an introduction to the [React](https://reactjs.org/) JavaScript library. It simply displays a list of monster cards with contact information that can be filtered by searching.

In building this app, I learned the ins and outs of the basic concepts of React. These include:

1. Setting up a React app with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
2. React [Architecture](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) concepts, like where to put the state.
3. [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).
4. The difference between [Function and Class](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) components.
5. React [State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html).
6. [Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html) with React.
